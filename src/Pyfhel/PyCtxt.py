#   PyCtxt
#   --------------------------------------------------------------------
#   PYthon CypherTeXT is a part of Pyfhel. PyCtxt implements the equivalent
#   to Ctxt class in Afhel (built on top of HElib) for cyphertexts, while
#   being able to hold several cyphertexts by their IDs and treat them as
#   a single one.
#   PyCtxt overrides +, -, * and @ with add, substract, mult and scalarProd
#   from Pyfhel.
